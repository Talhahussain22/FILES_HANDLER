This Python script provides basic file and folder management functionalities. It allows users to copy, move, and delete files or folders.

The copy function copies either a folder or a file based on user input using shutil.copytree or shutil.copy.
The move function moves a file or folder using shutil.move.
The delete_folder function deletes a folder and its contents using shutil.rmtree.
The delete_file function deletes a file using os.remove.
The main function presents a menu for the user to choose the operation. It then prompts for paths and calls the appropriate function.

This script provides basic file management capabilities but should be used with caution to avoid accidental data loss.
